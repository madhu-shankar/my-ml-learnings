# My Machine Learning Project

This project is designed to provide a structured approach to developing machine learning models using Python. It includes data processing, model training, and utility functions to streamline the workflow.

## Project Structure

```

├── notebooks
│   └── example_notebook.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook for documenting the ML workflow
├── src
│   ├── data_processing.py       # Functions for loading and processing datasets
│   ├── model.py                 # Definition of the machine learning model
│   └── utils.py                 # Utility functions for various tasks
├── requirements.txt             # List of project dependencies
└── README.md                    # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-ml-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks` directory to explore the machine learning workflow.
- Use the functions in `data_processing.py` to load and preprocess your datasets.
- Define and train your model using the `Model` class in `model.py`.
- Utilize the utility functions in `utils.py` for saving and loading models.
